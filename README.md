# Pricing-Convertible-Bonds-using-Cox-Ross-Rubistein-model
Pricing Convertible Bonds using Cox-Ross-Rubistein model for the course of Derivatives of the master in Financial Engineering at EPFL
In this project we have applied the Cox-Ross-Rubistein model to price different types of Convertible Bonds, in particular: Mandatory convertible bonds, Vanilla Convertible bonds and callable convertible bonds. This project has an application using Johnson and Johnson data.
This project is structured in five parts:
1. Introduction and Analysis of the Convertible bonds market;
2. Mathematical derivation used to prices these securities using European and American Derivatives;
3. Implementation of the code used to pricing in Python (.ipynb file available in Github
4. Analysis of the role of parameters and characteristics of these securities like coupon rate, dividend yields, call price, in the price.
5. Example of a term sheet that could be proposed to a firm.
